                    <p> This is the GUI for the implemented <b>spatial channel model (SCM)</b>. 
					</p>
					<p> <b>About the channel simulator: </b>
					<p> This is the implementation if the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) SCM <a href="#lit" class="tm-nav-link">[1]</a> in Python.
						 It is typically used to calculate the channel between the transmit (Tx) and receive (Rx) antennas.
						 In this web application, user is asked to enter the Tx and Rx coordinates together with other system parameters.
						 Then, after the calculations have been performed, the results are displayed in the form of the channel impulse response (CIR)
						 and the generated clusters and multipath components, which are shown on a separate page. 
						 This is done for demonstational purposes. However, if one needs to integrate this channel model for more than one Tx-Rx pair,
						 the Python-based code can be easily integrated in any simulator. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Currently, the 3GPP provides parameters for the SCM model for indoor hotspot (InH), 
						urban microcell (UMi), urban macrocell (UMa) and rural macrocell (RMa) 
						scenarios. Current implementation is parametrized with the <b>UMa</b> setup. To change the parameters, one needs to insert other parameters
						from the listed possible deployments. All these parameters can be found in [1].
					</p>
					</p>
					
					<p> <b> About the web architecture: </b>
					<p> 
					The HTTP server is alose implemented in Python using the http library.
					AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is used to send an asynchronous request to the server, which hosts the computation script. 
					After the computations are done, the results are coverted to the html formal using the mpld3 and plotly libraries, which allows keeping them interactive.
					The server starts a web server hosting the directory at http://localhost:8000.

                <p> This channel model is defined in the 3GPP standard TR 138.901 <a href="#lit" class="tm-nav-link">[1]</a>. 
				It suits for the frequency range from 0.5 up to 100 GHz.
				The main purpose of this model is to provide an estimation of channel conditions. 
				There are many other channel models exist for modeling communication channels, which are divided into the following categories: 
				</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Deterministic/Empirical (COST Hata, SUI)</li>
				  <li>Stochastic (METIS)</li>
				  <li>Geometry-based (Ray tracing, ray launching)</li>
				</ul>
				<p> The SCM belongs to a stochastic model. However, the parameters for this model were derived based on the real measurements.
				These parameters include large-scale parameters and
				small-scale parameters. The large-scale parameters define, e.g., shadow fading, delay spread, angular spread
				while the small-scale parameters define the delays, powers, departure and arrival angles within the cluster.
				The overall procedure of channel generation according to this model can be described with the following figure:
				</p>
				<img src="./fig/channel_gen_procedure.png"/>
				<p> 				
				According to this model, the received signal consists of N delayed paths of the transmitted signal. These N paths are
				defined by powers and delays and are chosen randomly according to the channel generation procedure. Each path
				consists of M subpaths. The subpaths within the cluster are correlated and they have similar angular and delay characteristics as it can be seed from the figure below.
				One major benefit of this model is that it provides spatial consistency as compared to many other stochastic models, which is provided by the correlation matrix.
				For system modeling in time, this model is typically used in the following way.
				The fast fading per-path evolves in time while the large-scale parameters such as, e.g., angular spread and delay spread remain fixed during the drop. 
				</p>

				<p>
				An antenna array is modeled according to <a href="#lit" class="tm-nav-link">[2]</a>, which implies that the resultant antenna pattern is represented as a superposition of element patterns.
				Therefore, the resultant Half Power Beam Width (HPBW) and the directional antenna gain of the antenna array depend on the number of antenna elements. 
				The pattern is used at the final step of the calculations to weight evey incomming paths and recalculate the received power.
